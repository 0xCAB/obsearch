OBSearch 0.9 released.

OBSearch 0.9 has been released.

Release Highlights:

- Many optimizations and tuning of many parameters. 
- The K-means subsystem was improved, now it is possible to select the best of several iterations for the algorithm.
- The P+Tree is now asymmetric. It will grow only if there is enough data.
- Unsafe Class: For those of you who want to be on the edge, there is an Unsafe version of the P+Tree that improves performance for big k and r.

Caveats:

- The way status results are returned has been modified. Please see OBExampleTrees.java for an example on how to use this status result class.
