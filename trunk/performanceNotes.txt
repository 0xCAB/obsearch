So it seems that od=9 works well for OBSlice.
Also TentaclePivotSelector* works a little better than
KMeansPPPivotSelector. 

For TentaclePivotSelector* a seedCount of 30 has worked well.

Doing this in the spaceNode:

 if(distanceL < distanceR){
                left.searchRange(query, object, result);
                right.searchRange(query, object, result);
            }else{        
                right.searchRange(query, object, result);
                left.searchRange(query, object, result);
            }

is not as good as this:

if(distanceL < distanceR){
								right.searchRange(query, object, result);
                left.searchRange(query, object, result);
                
            }else{
								 left.searchRange(query, object, result);       
                right.searchRange(query, object, result);
                
            }

when the k=20 and r=20
