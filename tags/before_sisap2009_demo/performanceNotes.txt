So it seems that od=9 works well for OBSlice.
Also TentaclePivotSelector* works a little better than
KMeansPPPivotSelector. 

For TentaclePivotSelector* a seedCount of 30 has worked well.

Doing this in the spaceNode:

 if(distanceL < distanceR){
                left.searchRange(query, object, result);
                right.searchRange(query, object, result);
            }else{        
                right.searchRange(query, object, result);
                left.searchRange(query, object, result);
            }

is not as good as this:

if(distanceL < distanceR){
								right.searchRange(query, object, result);
                left.searchRange(query, object, result);
                
            }else{
								 left.searchRange(query, object, result);       
                right.searchRange(query, object, result);
                
            }

In some cases...
when the k=20 and r=20

We want to find an object like r-1 so that we can prune more.
We want to find such objects fast, so that's why we should go
to the farthest subspaces first.


35% of the time is spent in readShortFast()

This is a lot of time! really. So we need to speed up this.

nov 30 2007 1:37am is a good benchmark. it shows that most of the time
is spent in converting bytes! :0)


About to work on verifying the speed of insersects improvement

je.evictor.lruOnly is not good at all.
